 DoD R&D FY21 spending geographic distribution projection

The goal of these scripts is to answer the following question: where is the Department of Defense spending 
its Research & Development dollars? 

We write scripts to fetch the Fiscal Year 2021 President's Budget request from the DoD Comptroller's website, 
and we fetch historical data from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Federal Funds for R&D. We then
clean and analyse the datasets, isolating DoD spending for all 50 United States and all countries internationally.

Next, we attach Geo-locator data (latitude and longitude) to the State and Country data, and fetch Shape Files 
from the web for the States and Countries. We then project a rough estimate of the geographic distribution 
for Fiscal Year 2021 DoD R&D dollars.
